# Power BI - Example Workforce Time Entries Report

I'm doing some freelance work, the client has asked me to automate some of the business reports. This is a Power BI dashboard I made using a sample of their dataset.

I've removed any sensitive employee information. 

The website is hosted on GitHub and the dashboard is hosted on the Microsoft Power BI servers.

Note: If the dashboard isn't available, I may have recently made a change which would take 10-15 mins to re-sync on server.
